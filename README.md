# Sagnik Saha — Cybersecurity Researcher & Bug Bounty Lead

> Precision-driven offensive security researcher focused on high-impact vulnerability discovery, OSINT intelligence, and pragmatic threat hunting.

---

## About

I am a results-oriented Cybersecurity Researcher and Bug Bounty Hunter with deep expertise in offensive security, web application and API testing, cloud assessments, and advanced OSINT. I combine manual exploitation, custom tooling, and LLM-assisted analysis to uncover complex, high-severity findings that automated scanners miss. I prioritize clear, defensible reporting and responsible disclosure aligned to industry standards.

Key professional traits:
- Methodical investigation and adversary-centric thinking
- Strong technical writing and evidence-driven reporting
- Coordinated disclosure and post-remediation verification
- Continuous learning: CTFs, vulnerability research, and red-team exercises
